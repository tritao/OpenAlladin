# OpenAladdin reverse-engineering ledger

This file is the index for the reproducible reverse-engineering record. It is
deliberately separate from implementation notes: a claim belongs here only
when a tracked source, a replayable campaign, or a deterministic analysis
artifact supports it.

The repository history is itself part of the record. Do not rewrite the
reverse-engineering commits or replace the ROM/emulator baseline without
adding a new dated baseline section.

## Recording contract

Every significant experiment should leave all of the following:

1. A tracked campaign or finding manifest under `re/mame/`.
2. The exact ROM hash, emulator revision, and harness commit in that manifest.
3. A replayable input schedule or loaded-state provenance.
4. Named MAME checkpoints for meaningful events, with state files retained in
   the ignored `build/re/` tree.
5. A short conclusion that labels each result as verified, negative evidence,
   or an unresolved hypothesis.
6. A commit containing the manifest/finding and any code or symbol changes.

Large traces and MAME `.sta` files remain ignored build artifacts. The tracked
manifest must point to them and `campaign.py verify` must pass before a
campaign is considered recorded. If a trace is regenerated, retain the same
input and state provenance and record the new output directory rather than
silently overwriting the old evidence.

For direct harness runs, use `tools/openaladdin/mame/run.sh`; it records the
ROM identity in the trace header and supports deterministic frame schedules,
saved-state loading, actor/RAM/VDP capture, and named checkpoints. For native
regressions, keep the corresponding MAME trace and the comparison command in
the finding or commit message.

## Verified evidence index

### Runtime and emulator

- `49f95cf` made direct MAME traces self-identify with the ROM hash.
- Relative saved-state paths are normalized by `run.sh`; the load-state smoke
  test is recorded in the platform-chain investigation.
- The normal trace path is headless, with Xvfb available through `MAME_XVFB=1`.

### Gameplay and actor behavior

- `d96db08`: fresh-boot level-01 baseline.
- `6c84fde`: fresh natural route progression through the opening route,
  including the upper ledge, lower chamber, wall, and handhold probes.
- `fb5100d`: bounce/handhold timing family; tested timings did not produce a
  transfer to the upper route.
- `183a082`: exact player-attack differential checkpoint; native and MAME
  state traces match for 47 frames from the synchronized checkpoint.
- `477f5c1`: apparent pre-wall platform chain classified as guard-sword child
  (`0x2D`) and oscillating interaction actor (`0x34`), not a traversable
  moving-platform transfer.
- `20260826-level01-recording-frontier-v1`: current-harness replay of the
  lower-gap → handhold → upper-platform → wall-rope chain, with 22 verified
  named checkpoints. The associated frontier matrix records the direct wall,
  upper-rope, upper-platform, and spring negative branches.

### Scene and exit work

- `re/mame/findings/level-transition-findings.json`: controlled scene-state
  transition proof and table/exit-gate work.
- `re/mame/findings/natural-exit-findings.json`: controller-only natural route
  currently reaches approximately world `x=2176`, `y=912` and does not reach
  the exit; the controlled boundary write path is known.
- `re/symbols/functions.yml`: level-01 enter/exit routines at `0x1B5B4A` and
  `0x1B6406`.

## Current frontier

The next search is not a new project bootstrap. It is a targeted level-01
geometry/object investigation. The extracted level package is available at
`build/assets/levels/level01/` and is derived from the ROM table entry at
`0x2CBA`:

- map: 300 x 45 terrain words, ROM source `0x195176`;
- floor/behavior data: ROM source `0x1434C4`;
- background block table: ROM source `0x145B2C`;
- enter routine: `0x1B5B4A`;
- exit routine: `0x1B6406`.

The immediate question is whether the wall at approximately world `x=2178`
is a genuine route boundary or whether a geometry/object/script transition
before it has not yet been identified. The next campaign must compare the
decoded terrain/floor records with actor/object traces and save a checkpoint
for every newly reached surface, interaction, or boundary.

## Campaign index

| Campaign | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `20260825-level01-canonical-v1` | in progress | original canonical route record |
| `20260826-level01-fresh-baseline-v1` | recorded | fresh boot baseline |
| `20260826-level01-recording-baseline-v1` | recorded | fresh boot baseline at the ledger commit |
| `20260826-level01-recording-frontier-v1` | recorded-frontier | current-harness route chain and upper-route frontier |
| `20260826-level01-fresh-route-probe-v1` | recorded | natural route and handhold probes |
| `20260826-level01-bounce-up-sweep-v1` | recorded | bounce timing sweep |
| `20260826-level01-route-expansion-v1` | in progress | route expansion and unresolved exit search |
| `20260826-level01-transition-v1` | controlled proof | scene-transition path |

When a campaign is superseded, leave it in this table. A negative result is
valuable because it prevents repeating the same input family.
